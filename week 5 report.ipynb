            "source": "information:In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city?\n\nresult:from the project and the presentation, we can find that there are also near the main street which is represented as the red line in the map\nThe most popular area in the Manhattan City is near the river, while the area in Toronto City has more bus stop nearby\nIf I want to open a hotel, it will be important  to choose a place with more convenient transport and it will be better to near the river.\n\n"
